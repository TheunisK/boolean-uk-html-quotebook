                    He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions 
                    to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. 
                    So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning fork that had been 
                    struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his lips’ touch she blossomed like a 
                    flower and the incarnation was complete."
